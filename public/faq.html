		<h1>2. Which languages are in the archive and how did you choose them?</h1>

			<p>First, I've chosen the ones that are based on the latin alphabet, so I could use the A-Z method. Second, I've checked their Autocomplete predictions. Not all of them work right for the location I am in. And not all services work for all languages. See the <a href="technology">technical explanation</a> for more information.</p> 

		<h1>3. Why are my Google suggestions different from the ones I see in your archive?</h1>

			<p>Mostly because your suggestions are based on your search and browsing history. They are highlighted in blue and show up first in your list.</p>

		<h1>4. Doesn't the same happen to the computer that is doing your archive?</h1>

			<p>No, because Google saves your information in your account or on your browser. The computer doing the archive doesn't have either of those â€” not even a browser. The way I described things on the <a href="about.html">About</a> was just to help you understand the process, but it's not exactly how it works.</p>

		<h1>5 - What about my location?</h1>

			<p>Yes, that affects both yours and mine results. That's the reason why I can't get results for any language (see #2).</p>
