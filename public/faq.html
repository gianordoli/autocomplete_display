			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h2>1. Why are my Google Autocomplete predictions different from the ones I see in your archive?</h2>

			<p>Mostly because your suggestions are based on your search and browsing history. They are highlighted in blue and show up first in your list.</p>

			<h2>2. Doesn't the same happen to the computer that is doing your archive?</h2>

			<p>No, because Google saves your information in your account or on your browser. The computer doing the archive doesn't have either of those — not even a browser. The way I described things on the About was just to help you understand the process, but it's not exactly how it works.</p>

			<h2>3 - What about my location?</h2>

			<p>Yes, that affects both yours and mine results. That's the reason why I can't get results for any language (see #4). I've compared some of my results with the ones from people in different countries — Germany, France, Brazil, Finland, and Italy. The difference ranges from 1 to 8%.</p>

			<h2>4. Which languages are in the archive and how did you choose them?</h2>

			<p>First, I've chosen the ones that are based on the latin alphabet, so I could use the A-Z method. Second, I've checked their Autocomplete predictions. Not all of them work right for the location I am in. And not all services work for all languages. See the <a href="technology.html">technical information</a> for more details.</p>

			<h2>5. How do the Autocomplete results compare with Google Trends?</h2>

			<p>The 50 most popular search terms from Trends usually show up on Autocomplete too. However, Google removes from Autocomplete some terms that might seem offensive. For instance, "hot girls" usually shows up as one of the most searched terms in Google Trends, but not on Autocomplete.</p>

			<p>Also, bear in mind that the 260 Autocomplete predictions (10 for each letter) are not exactly the 260 most popular search terms. That is because some letters are less frequent than others. For example, "W" is a pretty common initial for English, but barely used in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. And even within English, it might not be as common as "A."</p>

			<h2>5. Wait, if you get only words, what are those images and videos?</h2>

			<p>They are the first result you get when searching for the terms on Google Images or Youtube. Once again, see the <a href="technology.html">technical information</a> for more details.</p>
